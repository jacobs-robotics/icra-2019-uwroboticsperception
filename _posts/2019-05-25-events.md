**Here we announce exciting coming events or open job positions on underwater robotics**


## Breaking the Surface 2019
### International Interdisciplinary Field Workshop of Marine Robotics and Applications
### Links: [Website](http://bts.fer.hr/) ; [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BTSCroatia/)

Breaking the Surface – BTS is a one-of-a-kind summer workshop organized for the past 10 years on the Adriatic Coast in Croatia. This year’s edition of BTS will be held in Biograd na Moru from 29th September to 6th October, and it will feature lectures, tutorials, equipment demonstrations and workshops by experts in various marine and maritime fields of expertise (robotics, biology, archaeology, geology, maritime security etc). Over 180 attendees including students, members of academia, the scientific community and industry representatives are expected to take part in BTS 2019. Registrations at early bird prices are available at [bts.fer.hr/registration](bts.fer.hr/registration), while more information can be found on our official website or Facebook page.

## Heriot-Watt University -- Research Associate Positions
### Links: [Full Description](http://icra-2019-uwroboticsperception.ge.issia.cnr.it/assets/next-events/Advert-RAs-RAI-Hub.pdf); [Application website](https://www.hw.ac.uk/about/work/jobs/job_SVJDMTIxOTA.htm)

The multidisciplinary research team currently being assembled between Heriot Watt (Lead) and its partner universities (University of Edinburgh, Imperial College London, University of Liverpool, University of Oxford) will key scientific challenges including Mapping and Navigation, Planning and Execution , HRI and Certification of Robots and Assets. 

The positions advertised here (Research Associates in Marine Robotics) target cutting-edge research in the following areas:

1. Subsea 3D localisation, mapping subsea fusing acoustics (sonar), video and laser data and using the latest developments in Deep Learning to provide robust solutions in complex visibility conditions. Challenge (a). Collaboration with Oxford University.
2. Mapping and fusion approaches to extend the work of 1 to multi-robot scenarios and include sensor fusion across environments. Challenge (a). Collaboration with Oxford University and Imperial College London.

It is strongly recommended to contact Professor Yvan Petillot by email at **Y.Petillot@hw.ac.uk** for a first expression of interest, as well as any informal inquiry, prior to a formal application.
