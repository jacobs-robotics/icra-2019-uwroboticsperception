### INFORMATION FOR ACCEPTED PAPERS

Authors of accepted papers are expected to give a **lightning talk (5 minutes)** and to present a poster at the workshop. A number of papers will be selected for **15 minutes oral presentations**.

### MAIN TOPICS

These are the main topics of the workshop, but papers submissions on related subjects are welcomed. 

* Object detection and recognition in different sensor domains (stereo vision, lasers, acoustic sensors i.e. sonars, multibeam).
* Image enhancement and distortion removal (dehazing, color correction).
* Sensor fusion and signal processing.
* Environment modeling (bathymetry, 3D representation and mapping, SLAM).
* Simulated environments and continuous system integration (hardware-in-the-loop, synthetic data generation, simulation to real-world transition).
* Deep learning practices and machine learning pipelines in any of the above topics.
* Heavily tested systems in field trials and best practices for deployment and data management.
 

### SUBMISSIONS

We welcome submissions of 4-8 pages papers as PDF in the standard ICRA [**IEEE conference format**](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html ). All submissions will be peer-reviewed and selected based on their originality, technical quality, clarity and their relevance to workshop topics. We encourage the presentation of early research on emerging topics and early results, and the participation of young researchers in order to promote themselves within the community.

Please submit your paper through this [**link**](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICRAURP2019). 
To report any issues or questions about the submission process, send an email to both: **a.gomezchavez@jacobs-university.de** **AND** **enrica.zereik@ge.issia.cnr.it**
